# weather-service-go

This Weather service project hosts an http server that uses the Open Weather API that exposes an endpoint that takes in lat/long coordinates and return what the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain, etc), whether it’s hot, cold, or moderate outside.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or later
- Make
- Set up an account on [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get an API key for Current Weather Data API
- Update the `.env` file with the Open Weather API key `WEATHER_SERVICE_API_KEY`

### Running the application

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone
```

2. Change into the project directory

```bash
cd weather-service-go
```

3. Run the application

```bash
make run-api
```

The API server will start on port 8080.

4. To Run tests

Tests require the Open Weather API key to be set in the `.env` file.

```bash
make test
```

### OpenAPI Specifications

- The server code is generated from the OpenAPI specifications using `oapi-codegen`.
- The OpenAPI specifications for the project can be found in the `spec` directory.
- To generate the server code, run the following command:

```bash
make generate-api
```
- Any changes to the OpenAPI specifications should be followed by running the above command to generate the server code and implement the changes.

### Features

- [x] Get weather by lat/long

### API Endpoints

- `GET /weather?lat={latitude}&long={longitude}&units={units}` - Get weather by lat/long and units (metric, imperial)

**Temperature Description**

Use the main.temp from the Open Weather API response to determine the temperature description and apply the following rules:
- Cold: temp < 283.15 (10°C)
- Moderate: 283.15 ≤ temp < 293.15 (10°C to 20°C)
- Warm: 293.15 ≤ temp < 303.15 (20°C to 30°C)
- Hot: temp ≥ 303.15 (30°C)

**Weather Condition**

Use the weather.main field as is from the Open Weather API response. No transformation is needed.

**Response format:**

```json
{
  "temperatureCondition": "Cold",
  "temperature": 113,
  "weatherCondition": "Rain",
  "units": "metric"
}
```
